## ✧ About Me

Aspiring Full Stack Web Developer, currently studying and building every day.

I’m learning and working with:
HTML · CSS · JavaScript · Backend fundamentals

For me, code is not just logic — it’s transformation.  
It’s structure turned into experience.  
It’s invisible systems shaping visible worlds.

I care deeply about:
- Creative experimentation.  
- Innovation without chaos.  
- Visual storytelling.  
- Functional elegance.  
- Interfaces that feel intentional.

## ✧ Current Focus

• Mastering front-end foundations (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  
• Exploring backend logic and architecture.  
• Building mobile-first web applications.  
• Understanding how systems connect beneath the surface.  

Every project is part of the spell. Every bug is part of the ritual.

## ✧ Beyond Code

I love plants — tending to them feels like tending to living systems 🍃🍀

I’ve been writing since I was 10 years old.  
I published my first poetry book (https://amzn.eu/d/0869GGQ6), and I’m currently working toward publishing the first book of an anticipated fantasy trilogy.

Language fascinates me as much as code.
I speak: Spanish · German · Italian · English.

I am deeply autodidactic — constantly studying, observing and learning across disciplines.

## ✧ Philosophy

🪲 Code is modern alchemy.

You take symbols and intention,  
and something real appears.

Frontend is form.  
Backend is structure.  
Together, they become living architecture.

I am learning to build worlds — line by line.
